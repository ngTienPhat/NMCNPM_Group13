# EZNOTE

We try to build a taking note app based on Evernote. Once the users' devices connect to the internet, all of their notes will be uplaod to the server immediately and as a result, they can access it on multiple devices.

The note content could be not only raw text, but also multi media attachment (image, video, ...)

We also include some special functions:
- **Share notes with other users**: this feature allows user to create notes and pin it at a specific place. 
- **Find nearby notes**: people who open our app with the internet connection can find nearby notes pinned at their position.
- **Speech to text**: with this function, user can create text content by speaking to their device (hold on `microphone` button and speak anything they'd like to write down).
